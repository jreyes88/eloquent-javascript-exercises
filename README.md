# Eloquent JavaScript Exercises

I've been meaning to do this for a while now. As I'm reading through Eloquent JavaScript, I'll be trying out each of the exercises, hopefully coming up with an answer, and then comparing my answer to the solutions found over at [https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript/](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript/).


Many thanks to Marijn Haverbeke for this wonderful and challenging book. While I'm working out of the Second Edition, the Third Edition can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-3rd-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593279507/).
